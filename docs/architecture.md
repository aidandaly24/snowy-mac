# Architecture and resource limits

A native macOS 14+ menu-bar app that puts gentle, interactive snowfall over the desktop, between the wallpaper and desktop widgets/icons. Native windows and widgets sit above the snow. App windows, widgets, Spotlight, and a bottom-positioned Dock collect it and block its motion. Vertical Docks are excluded from the simulation. Swept snow can travel to other surfaces or build up at the screen bottom. All clicks and drags pass through.

For quick installation and everyday controls, see the [README](../README.md). This document records the native simulation, its limits, and the assumptions behind public macOS geometry.

## Build and use

Requires Xcode with the Metal toolchain installed. Swift Package Manager resolves the pinned Sparkle updater.

```sh
./scripts/build-app.sh
```

This creates `build/Snowy.app`, with compiled Metal shaders and a local ad-hoc signature. Open the app yourself when ready; the build script does not launch it. When updating, **quit the running Snowy from its snowflake menu before reopening the rebuilt app**. The menu offers Pause/Resume, Clear Settled Snow, Cursor Tool → Glove/Shovel, Light, Steady, Flurry, Wind…, and Quit. Newly detected sky-exposed surfaces start with a thin dusting, then gradually build a cap.

Choose **Wind…** for the native dot-grid arrow control. Drag from its center to rotate and stretch the arrow: angle changes direction and length changes strength. Shift snaps to compass directions. Left/right keys rotate; up/down change strength; Option makes fine adjustments. Reset, Space, or Home returns to calm. Wind is saved and affects falling flakes and detached snow. The arrow rubber-bands during a long pull, changes thickness as it stretches/compresses, and settles briefly on release. The panel dismisses on outside clicks, its Close button, or Escape. The control uses percentage strength, not a claim of real-world meteorological speed. Reduced Motion snaps presentation changes immediately.

For development, open `Package.swift` in Xcode or use `swift run Snowy`. The development path compiles the bundled shader source once at startup. The packaged app uses a precompiled shader library. A Developer ID signature and notarization are separate distribution steps; this build is for local use on the build machine's architecture.

```sh
swift test
```

Tests exercise only the geometry, simulation, and power policy. They do not create app windows, inspect the live desktop, or measure CPU/GPU performance.

## Reference interpretation

The visual direction is a shallow, continuous cap inspired by Apple Weather. The implementation follows these material rules:

- Fine, slow flakes at varied depths, with a few larger, softer foreground flakes and a gentle lateral sway.
- A shallow connected cap with broad, irregular lobes, a bright upper edge, cool shading at the base, and tapered corners. This follows the requested Apple Weather direction rather than making a pile of individually rendered balls.
- Displaced snow is a cellular granular material. It has local occupancy/compression, downward and diagonal flow, repose against obstacles, and redeposition onto the existing smooth profiles. It has no launch velocity, particle lifetime, mass-scaled ellipse, or large airborne sprite. A connected contour mesh is reconstructed from neighbouring occupied cells using the same snow shading as the stable caps.
- The 24-point glove displaces a travel-proportional amount. **Cursor Tool → Shovel** selects a stronger, 36-point rigid exclusion area that pushes all contacted snow out of its radius, including while held still. Displaced area stays in the material field or on supports; an exhausted pool/search returns unplaced area to its source rather than deleting it. A completely sealed/saturated space cannot be physically emptied without somewhere to put its material.
- Persistent window IDs represent moving boundaries. Translation or outward resizing pushes intersected snow along the entering face, including fast sweeps between snapshots. Caps belonging to that window move with their support. Newly appearing IDs erase their covered snow instead. Profile updates and boundary motion are applied in one scene transaction. Each visited native desktop has its own panel, snow simulation, and decoration instances. Panels stay attached to that desktop instead of joining all Spaces and use the managed collection behavior so WindowServer can animate them during desktop swipes and Mission Control. Inactive scenes retain their snow and prop positions, pause their clocks, and release GPU mesh/particle buffers. Only the active desktop accepts window metadata. Public `NSWindow.isOnActiveSpace` identifies returning panels, without private Space identifiers. The eight most recently used desktops per physical display are kept in memory; quitting or changing the physical display layout clears this transient state. Fullscreen and sleep suppression still apply.
- Attached caps also sweep against other persistent windows and widget boundaries before following a dragged support. Only contacted material detaches; it stays on the approach side in the existing granular field or bounded reserve. Continuous relative contacts include fast crossings, rounded corners, and undersides. A diagonal drag cannot hand snow to a later lower support through an earlier wall. New contacts enter the field after window-boundary pushes, preventing the carrier from pushing them twice.
- When a window descends across another existing top, its overlapping cap area hands off to the first crossed support. Non-overlapping columns continue riding the moving window. The handoff is captured before attachment transforms and deposited after boundary pushes, so the snow neither disappears inside the lower window nor gets pushed twice. Coplanar tops stay exposed. A full receiver spills into granular storage; a bounded explicit retry queue preserves area if both capacity and storage are exhausted.
- Horizontal wind changes incoming snowfall around protruding walls. Rightward wind suppresses new snowfall on the right/downwind side and builds the left/upwind drift; leftward wind mirrors this. The snowfall-shadow radius scales with horizontal strength up to 96 points, with a short fade beyond it. A shallow protrusion has a weaker effect and coplanar tops create no wall wake. Deposition can rise up to 2.25 times locally, while physical maximum heights remain 18 points for windows, 13 for the Dock, and 28 for the floor. Existing piles stay in place when wind changes. Glove/shovel pushes, moving boundaries, support handoffs, and loose grains can still place snow in the shadow, using the same physical capacity as in calm weather. Initial dusting and incoming flake landings obey the snowfall shadow.
- A bottom-positioned Dock gets a low ridge along its upper surface. Snow shed from a shrinking hover footprint enters the existing material field instead of being discarded; exhausted storage retains it for retry. Left/right Docks contribute no supports, collisions, or snowfall shadows, including during hover animations. No ridge is invented for a hidden Dock.
- WindowManager's screen-edge tiling previews are presentation overlays: they neither clear piles nor become snow supports. Real app windows retain their normal physical boundaries when tiled.
- Spotlight's search panel collects a rounded cap even over another app. Only that attached cap uses a small elevated strip; ordinary snowfall stays below native windows. On dismissal, the exposed cap enters the existing granular field and falls onto lower supports or the floor. Snow covered by native windows as it returns to the desktop plane disappears, so it cannot remain trapped and pop out later. Unplaced exposed area stays in a bounded retry reserve. Glove/shovel pushes can redistribute the attached cap along Spotlight when a window behind it blocks the desktop material field.
- Surfaces under an overhead window receive no direct ambient deposition. A floating window still leaves physical room for swept snow to travel below it. Opening a new window deletes its covered pile columns permanently. Moving an existing window ploughs that material instead of treating every position update as another eraser.
- Full piles stop accepting additional snowfall but keep recycling incoming flakes, so snow continues falling at the selected density.
- Granular landing also recognizes material already touching a growing smooth profile. A neighbour's deposition cannot strand an existing grain inside a Dock/window cap merely because the next crossing time would be negative.

## Resource design

These are implementation limits, **not benchmark results or a measured CPU/battery guarantee**. Automated validation covers source builds, shader compilation, and deterministic headless tests. It does not verify native gesture feel or exact visible alignment on a particular desktop.

- **30 fps normally**, 20 in Low Power Mode, 15 at serious thermal pressure; critical thermal pressure suspends rendering and tracking. Reduced Motion uses quiet, slowly forming drifts with no decorative falling flakes at 15 fps. Functional granular displacement remains available; the wind-pad spring snaps immediately.
- **Global budgets across up to six displays:** at most 900 decorative falling flakes, 24,576 active granular cells, 131,072 allocated grid cells, 4,096 height samples, and 48 window/widget/Dock/floor surfaces. Area-based allocation prevents every monitor from multiplying those limits. Steady snowfall uses fewer than the maximum flakes. Collision geometry is capped at 64 rectangles per display, separate from the surface budget.
- **At most six million combined drawable pixels**, capped at 1.5 pixels per point normally and 1 in energy-saving modes. Two drawable buffers per display; no MSAA, depth/stencil textures, full-screen blur, bloom, or intermediate render passes. The active color drawable allocation alone is at most approximately 48 MB; cached desktops can retain additional last-presented surfaces for native swipe animations; WindowServer, driver, pipeline, and other app allocations are additional.
- **Normally one render pass and at most two draw calls per visible display:** a batched drift mesh and instanced flake quads. Pipelines and one Metal command queue are shared. An available integrated/low-power GPU is preferred to avoid waking a discrete GPU for decoration.
- **Spotlight's temporary cap strip shares that frame.** While search is visible, one additional paused Metal view renders only its cap ranges from the same mesh buffer and command buffer. The main frame explicitly drives its draw cycle so MetalKit advances its drawable correctly. It has no separate simulation, render timer, or flake pass. Its logical region is capped at the display width by 128 points and counts toward the existing six-million-pixel drawable budget. The desktop draw skips those cap ranges. The strip is click-through and follows the normal pause, sleep, session, and fullscreen gates.
- **Reusable bounded CPU/GPU storage.** Profiles settle at most 10 times per simulated second using conservative pairwise volume transfers. Active brushing and support motion rebuild meshes immediately at the frame rate. Two reusable buffer slots keep in-flight writes separate. The CPU never explicitly waits for GPU completion; a busy buffer pool skips the decorative frame. No per-flake views, layers, timers, textures, or physics bodies. Wind UI redraws for input/focus/appearance, plus a short-lived spring timer after release; the timer stops on settling, reset, dismissal, or loss of its view.
- **Bounded cellular work.** The sparse active-cell list advances with double-buffered area grids at a fixed 60 Hz, with at most three ticks per rendered frame and no catch-up backlog. Several incoming grains reserve a target's vacancy so cells cannot overcompress. Rounded obstacle unions are rasterized by row differences in grid-linear work rather than testing every cell against every window. Placement uses a reused flood frontier, at most 768 cells per local search, and at most 65,536 placement/path visits per simulation or scene update. Exhaustion preserves source-owned area. Terrain callbacks transfer settled area back to the smooth cap profiles. There is no projectile expiry. The contour generator visits only quads adjacent to active cells and is capped at twelve vertices per active cell; its mesh shares the existing snow render pass.
- **Rendering memory remains explicit.** The mesh capacity now includes the granular contour (at most 344,064 vertices globally, sixteen bytes each). Two reusable GPU buffers plus the CPU mesh reserve approximately 16.5 MB for these vertices; allocated grids, active lists, and contour marks add a bounded few megabytes. These figures exclude framework/driver/WindowServer allocations and are allocation calculations, not measured process memory or energy results.
- **Corner wind is cached.** Incoming-snowfall deposition and saturation masks are rebuilt only when wind or scene geometry changes, at existing profile resolution. They neither change physical capacity nor scan/evacuate granular material. Support-handoff retries are bounded by the existing height-sample budget; all searches retain the same granular work/allocation caps.
- **Decorations share the existing desktop panel and snow budgets.** Each custom scene holds at most 16 props and six light strings with six joints per string. Native windows and the Dock keep priority for collision and snow supports. Rope motion uses the existing frame clock at up to 30 Hz, and calm settled ropes skip redraws. Reduce Motion suppresses wind and cursor sway.
- **Material release is bounded.** Three reusable release/contact arrays each hold at most the existing height-sample count. Repeated dismissals or contacts with exhausted granular storage coalesce reserve entries rather than losing area or growing storage. New-window coverage clips retained vertical column intervals before insertion; release retries share the existing granular placement-work allowance. Carried caps use at most ten vertical samples per occupied profile column and only test persistent bodies overlapping their swept band. This work runs with scene updates rather than introducing another render or physics clock.
- **Full window discovery at most twice per second at rest**, up to ten times per second while a mouse button is down. Between full scans, the selected moving window is queried by ID at up to 30 Hz using `CGWindowListCreateDescriptionFromArray`; its result is merged into the record cache. Mouse release triggers a final full refresh. Queries run serially off the main actor, with only one in flight. Generation checks discard stale results. Fully fullscreen displays are checked at most once per second to detect a return to the desktop.
- **No rendering over detected fullscreen content.** Pause, display sleep, an inactive login session, and critical heat stop the metadata timer as well as the render loops. Drawable attachments are released while paused. Notifications restore the appropriate policy; the app does not prevent App Nap or system sleep. A desktop panel's bounding-box occlusion flag is intentionally not used to stop animation, because transparent full-display Finder/widget containers can report that flag even when snow is visible.

## Personal desktop features

Each cached desktop owns its weather, scene configuration, a bounded group of optional winter
friends, and its play objects. Cozy Village fits the original scenery across
floor and Dock rails using actual sprite widths and stable per-prop IDs. Its
factory layout reflows when the first Dock snapshot arrives or Dock bounds
change; explicit scene edits and saved presets retain their positions. Warm
lights complete the scene. Blizzard increases snowfall and uses bounded
sinusoidal gusts. The particle and simulation storage caps do not increase. Boundary emission
samples incoming flux through top/bottom and upwind sides to avoid a clear wedge
in lateral storms. Gradual wind erosion conserves cap plus granular area and
leaves unplaced snow on its source when storage is exhausted. Eight native gust
streaks use tight layer bounds and the existing clock.
Hanging-wire supports catch 20% of ambient flakes by default. Each swept query
samples a support once across all its buckets, so a missed flake continues to
lower supports in the same sweep. Ambient dusting and deposition use the same
fraction; transported snow retains physical contacts for mass conservation. The
Vibes slider changes the current desktop's fraction without clearing its snow,
and saved presets persist it with a 20% fallback for older data.
Scene controls synchronize to the active desktop without broadcasting changes
to the other cached desktops.

Friends, footprints and snowballs use a small bounded set of native layers above
the snow view. They advance from the renderer's existing frame callback, with no
additional timers. Friends subtract native window/Dock bounds and other residents' actual sprite
widths from their walking lanes. Mixed groups advance in sequence, so each step
respects the preceding resident's updated position. A covered resident relocates
to free ground, or stays hidden until room is available. Tiny pockets remain
idle, cursor-facing has an eight-point deadband, and gait advances only while
moving. Friends walk in the village foreground, pause
to greet neighbors and visit landmarks, and notice exposed cursors. Groups are
capped at five residents; tracks are capped at 72 and fade after 18 seconds. Snowballs are
capped at eight and use continuous contacts against window bodies and the floor.
Their impacts feed the existing bounded granular snow field. Snowman construction
adds an ordinary prop, subject to the existing 16-prop scene cap.

The click-through panel observes an Option gesture only in a selected play tool;
it does not capture mouse clicks or install a global event tap. Window shakes
require several rapid horizontal reversals during an actual mouse drag. Snow
that cannot fit in granular storage remains on the shaken cap.

Battery-Friendly Mode keeps the desktop layer visible, disables ambient flakes
and accumulation, freezes wandering and decorative wind, and polls interactions
at 10 Hz. The Metal renderer skips unchanged static meshes. It is separate from
Pause, which hides the snow. Core tests verify that static battery scenes neither
regrow snow nor rebuild their mesh, while sweeping still displaces snow.

## Window geometry and privacy

The app reads window IDs, process IDs, levels, bounds, and opacity through `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`. Numeric values are decoded through `NSNumber`, independent of their underlying CFNumber encoding. Its own overlays and wallpaper/desktop-sized containers are excluded; compact desktop widget windows at negative levels are retained. NotificationCenter/WidgetKit host processes are identified by bundle IDs, without titles. All physical window rectangles clip snow-bearing edges because every native window sits above the snow panel. Closed/minimized windows disappear from the current on-screen list. A persistent floor surface is included first so it survives budget truncation.

System roles use bundle identity: the installed WindowManager family is excluded, and Spotlight's bounded search panels are retained at their elevated window level. Exact public WindowServer owner names provide a fallback for Spotlight, WindowManager, and Dock UI services absent from the process-role cache; no extra process query is needed. Application lifecycle notifications invalidate the cached role lookup so first activation does not wait for the five-second periodic refresh. Search contents and window titles are not read or retained. Expanded and wide search panels are supported; full-display hosts are excluded. Spotlight's attached cap ignores lower-plane geometry; released snow returns to the normal desktop plane.

Dock detection accepts only horizontal bottom trays. A configured left/right orientation excludes all Dock-owned geometry, including transient horizontal windows; vertical geometry is also rejected when preferences are unavailable. Real opaque bottom tray frames take precedence. If Quartz omits the tray or exposes only transparent/oversized hosts, a freshly observed per-screen `NSScreen.visibleFrame` bottom reservation supplies the collider's roof and height. A compact footprint refines its width when available; otherwise bounded tile-size/item-count geometry estimates the centered width. Reservations below 20 points are ignored, including auto-hide reveal strips. An observed screen with no bottom reservation cannot gain a host-only phantom Dock. Transparent or oversized host rectangles never become full-display colliders. One reserved Dock support ID survives fallback/native transitions; the native window ID is retained separately for candidate preference. Screen reservations and preferences refresh at most twice per second. No item titles or paths are retained. The fallback width remains an estimate; recents, transient apps, minimization, magnification, and auto-scaling can affect its alignment. The app reads `NSEvent.mouseLocation` while rendering; it does not intercept input or install global event taps. Apple's [visible-frame contract](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsscreen/visibleframe) describes the Dock reservation and the need to refresh it as system UI changes.

Snow and widgets use public window bounds. Finder icon anchors use read-only Accessibility queries when explicitly enabled, limited to the editor and active scenes with icon anchors. Snowy keeps imported wallpaper copies, scenes, and preferences locally. Sparkle checks a signed GitHub release feed and downloads an update when requested. External geometry and preference hints are validated and bounded before allocating simulation storage.

Public window metadata does not describe arbitrary silhouettes, exact corner radii, or the Dock's animated magnification contour. Supports and collisions use rounded profiles with per-kind radius estimates. Widget host frames are inset by 8 points horizontally, 16 at the top, and 8 at the bottom to approximate the visible tile; these are explicit geometry-only estimates, not captured alpha bounds. Widget hosting/window levels are not a stable public contract. Tracking can lag by a polling interval, especially for programmatic/non-mouse moves. Fullscreen suppression recognizes a front window covering the complete display. Dock fallback and custom window shapes may need further alignment on the target desktop. No private APIs or screen capture are used to infer them.

### Curved light-wire snow

A light string exposes a bounded 48-sample support contour, with windows clipping
visibility and snowfall exposure. Snow meshes and continuous particle contacts
use the sampled base height. Wire caps have a three-point depth limit. At most six
wire supports share the existing surface budget, with a small reservation before
prop silhouette detail. Wire geometry is sampled at most 10 Hz as ropes move;
unchanged supports do not update the simulation. Removing a wire releases its
retained snow through the existing bounded release path.

### Vibe settings

The Vibes page and menu controls use one observable settings model, synchronized
without triggering mutation callbacks. Each active desktop receives weather,
friends, and scene changes independently. Named preset overrides serialize a
bounded scene, weather and group choices into a size-limited UserDefaults record.
They contain no native Space identifiers. The settings window opens on the active
Space, and its mouse-covered region does not brush the desktop snow behind it.
